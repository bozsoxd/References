# Description
- My goal was to create a software solution that would help radiologists in emergency trauma care to determine from CT scans of the brain of patients with head injuries whether there is a brain hemorrhage on the scan.
- For this, I have created an artificial intelligence, deep learning solution based on a convolutional neural network. It receives DICOM format image slices as input, which have been annotated by radiologists with the presence and type of bleeding. These DICOM slices are received by the network as 3-channel image files, and their label is an n-class binary vector. I developed and trained this network with different parameters and tried to create a version with it that has the highest possible accuracy metric.
- I evaluated the network from several points of view and created a demo application for it for testability, where it can be tested and tried with its own brain CT scan images, which foreshadows the usability of various own databases.
