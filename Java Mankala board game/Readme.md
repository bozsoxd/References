# Description

Mancala is a generic name that encompasses a family of two-player board games. Mancala plays a similar role in African and Asian countries as chess does in Europe. I am implementing a specific rule-based implementation of this family. The game board can be taken as a 2x8 matrix, in which the first and last columns can be understood as a hole, and each row of every other column can also be considered as a hole, so the board consists of a total of 12 single-cell and 2 2-cell holes.
