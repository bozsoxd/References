# Introduction
This is an application where you can store a gym workout. It is broken down by workout day, the exercises for that day, the number of sets and reps, and the amount of weight used. The idea came from the fact that I also go to the gym and I would find such an application useful. The target audience of the application is all athletes who would like to organize and store their performance for tracking purposes.
