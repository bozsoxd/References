# Description

The software is a two-team strategy game where one team's goal is to get the water to the finish line, while the other team's goal is to prevent this.
First, we created a framework that illustrates the basic connections and structure of the program under construction.
After that, a playable but not yet complete version is created.
Finally, the graphical display and the full game was implemented.
