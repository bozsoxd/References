# Description

This project contains two OpenGL projects written in C++. The first is a simple game played on a hyperbolic geometry, while the second is a room realized by ray tracing. For OpenGL, I used the freeglut and glew libraries.

## Project 1

In this project, two circular "head" move on the hyperbolic plane and try to eat each other. The eyes of the "heads" always look at the other "head".

## Project 2

In this project, two circular "head" move on the hyperbolic plane and try to eat each other. The eyes of the "heads" always look at the other "head".
